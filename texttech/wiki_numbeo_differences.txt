# CONVERSION DIRECTION: 
# WIKI TO NUMBEO
# 
# example wiki URL: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg
# example numb URL: numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Regensburg
#
# key differences:

# Wiki sometimes links cities with e.g. Bundesland information after a comma
# /wiki/Herne,_North_Rhine-Westphalia

# Wiki has Umlaute, numbeo doesn't: 
# "/wiki/SaarbrÃ¼cken", "numbeo.../Saarbrucken"
# 
# Wiki splits words with underscore, numbeo with hyphen:
# "/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau", "numbeo.../Freiburg-Im-Breisgau"
#
# numbeo capitalizes all words in city names that consist of more than 1 word:
# "wiki/Offenbach_am_Main", "numbeo.../Offenbach-Am-Main-Germany"
# --> capitalize all words after getting wiki URL as input
#
# on numbeo, some cities have a "-Germany" after the city name
# --> create if loop: if "Kassel" doesn't exist, try appending "-Germany"
# if this also doesn't exist, skip this city

# other differences: Halle_(Saale)
