CONVERSION DIRECTION:
WIKI TO NUMBEO

example wiki URL: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg
example numb URL: numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Regensburg

--- Key differences:---

Wiki sometimes links cities with e.g. Bundesland information after a comma
/wiki/Herne,_North_Rhine-Westphalia

Wiki has Umlaute, numbeo doesn't:
"/wiki/SaarbrÃ¼cken", "numbeo.../Saarbrucken"

Wiki splits words with underscore, numbeo with hyphen:
"/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau", "numbeo.../Freiburg-Im-Breisgau"

numbeo capitalizes all words in city names that consist of more than 1 word:
"wiki/Offenbach_am_Main", "numbeo.../Offenbach-Am-Main-Germany"
--> capitalize all words after getting wiki URL as input

on numbeo, some cities have a "-Germany" after the city name
--> create variants of city names with and without "-Germany"

other differences: Halle_(Saale)
